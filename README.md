# Github issues tech challenge
Your task is to replicate the Github issues page for the React repo.

https://github.com/facebook/react/issues

We are not expecting the whole page to be built and so you can concentrate on whichever parts you think would best demonstrate your skills.

You will have around 45mins-1hour to get as far as you can.

## Tech

We have provided a skeleton React application (create-react-app) which you can clone. 

You can use which ever styling/CSS solution you are comfortable with.

You can import any libraries you see fit although the more heavy lifting you do yourself the better!

## What we are assessing:
- Your technical competence
- Your use of best practices
- Your ability to explain what you are doing
- Your elaboration on techniques/concepts that you donâ€™t have enough time to implement
