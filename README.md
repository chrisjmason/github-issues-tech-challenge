# Github issues tech challenge
Your task is to create a replica of the Github issues page for the React repo.

https://github.com/facebook/react/issues

You will have around 45mins-1hour to get as far as you can.

We are not expecting the whole page to be built and we use the same task for every level of developer so concentrate on whichever parts you think would best demonstrate your skills.

Please create a branch off of master to work on and push your changes at the end of the challenge.

## Tech

We have provided a skeleton React application (create-react-app) which you can clone or feel free to set up the react project yourself. 

You can use which ever styling/CSS solution you are comfortable with.

You can import any libraries you see fit although the more heavy lifting you do yourself the better!

## What we are assessing:
- Your technical competence
- Your use of best practices
- Your ability to explain what you are doing
- Your ability to elaborate on techniques/concepts that you don't have enough time to implement in this session
